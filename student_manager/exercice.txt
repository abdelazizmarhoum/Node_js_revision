Create a new folder named student_manager.

Open the folder in a terminal and initialize a Node.js project.

Install the necessary dependencies: express, mysql, and body-parser.

Create the files index.js and index.html inside the project folder.

Explain the purpose of index.js, index.html, and package.json.

Import the required modules in index.js: mysql, express, body-parser, fs.

Create an Express application instance.

Configure the application to use body-parser for JSON and URL-encoded form data.

Declare a variable port and set it to 4000.

Connect to a MySQL database named students using the proper connection parameters (host, user, password, database).

Display a message in the console when the database connection is successful or failed.

Create a GET route / that serves the index.html file using the fs module.

Create a POST route /student to insert a new student into the database using data sent from the form.

Create a GET route /students to retrieve all students from the database and return them in JSON format.

Create a GET route /student/:id to retrieve a single student by ID and return it in JSON format.

Create a PUT route /student/:id to update the name, class, and age of a student based on their ID.

Create a DELETE route /student/:id to remove a student from the database using their ID.

Start the server on the specified port and display a message in the console indicating the server is running.

Create an index.html form to add a new student with input fields for:

Name

Class

Age

A submit button

Ensure the input name attributes match the keys expected in your POST route (name, student_class, age).

Explain how the form sends data to the server using the POST method.

Test each route using either a browser or Postman to verify the CRUD operations work correctly:

Add a student

Retrieve all students

Retrieve a student by ID

Update a student

Delete a student

Explain why req.body is used for POST/PUT data and req.params is used for URL parameters.

Explain the difference in MySQL callbacks: when to use (err) vs (err, results).
